# silver-svc-billing-mesh

`silver-svc-billing-mesh` treats backend services as a local verification problem. The Kotlin implementation is intentionally narrow, but the fixtures and notes make the behavior explicit.

## Silver Svc Billing Mesh Checkpoints

Treat the compact fixture as the contract and the extended examples as a scratchpad. The code should stay boring enough that a change in behavior is obvious from the test output.

## Useful Pieces

- Includes extended examples for queue pressure, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents bounded workers tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## What This Is For

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Project Layout

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Architecture Notes

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps job state, retry rules, and queue pressure in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 176, with risk penalty 6, latency penalty 4, and weight bonus 4. The Kotlin version keeps data classes and model logic close together for a JVM-friendly core.

## Local Workflow

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Case Study

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Quality Gate

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Scope

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Expansion Ideas

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more backend services fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Tooling

The only required setup is the local Kotlin toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.
